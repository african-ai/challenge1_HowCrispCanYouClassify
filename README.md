# How Crisp Can you Classify? : A Data Challenge to flex your classification skills 

## Data Challenge Task
This Data Challenge has 2 tasks;
* to determine the type of an Iris plant given data on sepal and petal lengths and widths of the flowers

* to identify a digit/number given optical data from handwritten digits

## Data Challenge Bounty
### USD 100 
to the highest ranked model submission, based on the Git timestamps 
### USD 10 
to the next top 10 ranked submissions, based on Git timestamps
### Invitation to an Exclusive Data Hackathon 
Where we will hack on a real businessâ€™ data and stand a chance to win even more exciting prizes and learn from experienced mentors 
[this is for those based in or willing to travel to Nairobi]

## Due Date: August 10th

###### Rules of Engagement
The Data Challenge is judged based on the following criteria:
  - A Correct fork, branch and pull request
  - Using the GitHub Pull Request timestamp where order of submissions is applicable
  - Using solution quality/accuracy and explanation to rank submissions where applicable 
  - Do not share any code that you cannot open source on the Git Repository as its open source and african.ai will not be liable for any breach of intellectual property (if at all) once shared on the platform.

## Working on the Data Challenge
1.Fork the code challenge repository provided.

2.Make a topic branch. In your github form, keep the master branch clean. When you create a branch, it essentially will be a copy of the master.

>Pull all changes, make sure your repository is up to date

```sh
$ cd challenge1_HowCrispCanYouClassify
$ git pull origin master
```

>Create a new branch as follows-> git checkout -b [your_phone_number_email], e.g.

```sh
$ git checkout -b 2348177779360_youremail@gmail.com master
```

>See all branches created

```sh
$ git branch
* 2348177779360_youremail@gmail.com
  master
```

>Push the new branch to github

```sh
$ git push origin -u 2348177779360_youremail@gmail.com
```

3.**Remember to only make changes to the fork!**

The folder named **data** contains 4 csv files. 
* iris_train
* iris_test
* digits_train
* digits_test

The folder names **submissions** contains 2 csv files.
* digits_sample_submission
* iris_sample_submission

The train datasets contain labelled records, ie. their classes are known.
In each case:
* use the train datasets to train a satisfactory classification model
* use the model to classify the records in the test datasets
* ensure the format of your submission files is similar to the 
* once satisfied with the model and the predictions, name the file containing labelled test data **iris_test_labelled** or **digit_test_labelled** and include it in the **submissions** folder, submission files should include only 2 columns, the id and the predicted labels
* Add to the base of the existing README file a brief explanation about your solution outlining the algorithm you chose to use, why you chose it and how the algorithm compared to any others you may have tried to use  

4.Commit the changes to your fork.

5.Make a pull request to the **challenge1_HowCrispCanYouClassify** Repo.

##### Explanation
After importing the necessary libraries, data was imported into the IDE and cleaned. The necessary features were collected and set together, separate from the target variable. Models were then fitted through the train data before being used to predict the test data. This procedure was done using Gaussian Naive Bayes and Random Forest. Random Forest model yielded a very high accuracy score on both Iris and Digits dataset and hence considered optimal in producing the output. The digits dataset required setting the axis name to 'id' and this was done before printing the output.
